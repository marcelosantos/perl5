=head1 NAME

perldeprecation - list Perl deprecations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this document is to document what has been deprecated
in Perl, and by which version the deprecated feature will disappear,
or, for already removed features, when it was removed.

This document will try to discuss what alternatives for the deprecated
features are available.

The deprecated features will be grouped by the version of Perl in
which they will be removed.

=head2 Perl 5.24

=head3 Use of C<< *glob{FILEHANDLE} >>

The use of C<< *glob{FILEHANDLE} >> was deprecated in perl 5.008.
The intention was to use C<< *glob{IO} >> instead, for which 
C<< *glob{FILEHANDLE} >> is an alias.

However, this feature was undeprecated in perl 5.24.0.
